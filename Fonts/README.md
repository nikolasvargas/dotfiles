## Quick Installation
---------------------

You can copy and paste these commands to your terminal. Comments are fine too.
::
    # clone
    git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
    # install
    cd fonts
    ./install.sh
    # clean-up a bit
    cd ..
    rm -rf fonts

Uninstall
---------
Run ``./uninstall.sh`` to uninstall all Powerline Fonts. You can also copy
the quick installation commands changing only the line ``./install.sh`` to
``./uninstall.sh``.

In both cases, please make sure you are working with the exact same version
of Powerline fonts you had checked out while installing.
